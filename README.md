# Microsoft-DNS-Permutations
Permutations is a mathematical term that relates to the act of arranging multiple attributes into sequences. When looking at DNS permutations, we are looking to identify all possible sequences that relate to the given domain or order to determine possible phishing threats. Reliance acsn’s Managed Detection and Response team have seen that threat actors orchestrate targeted phishing attacks, they will often register domains like the targeted organisation in order to exploit typing errors or an end user’s inattention to the authenticity of the domain.  Actors will often use this technique in order to create the likes of web traffic diversions, spear-phishing downloads, phishing confidential details or sending nefarious emails to company clients or employees. 												

This repo looks to identify permutations of Microsoft services.
